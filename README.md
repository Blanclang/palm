# ![logo](src/assets/images/logo-sm.png)palm

A check list site developed with React.

*This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).*


## tl;dr
``` bash
npm install -g create-react-app

git clone https://github.com/jonashao/palm.git
cd palm
npm install
npm start

```
Then open http://localhost:3000/ to see the app.

*At present, you wouldn't see any data in the site, because leancloud is not [configed](https://github.com/jonashao/palm/src/avconfig.jsx), but I am preparing some fake data.*

you can configure your own leancloud account,

or visit the [Demo site](http://palm.leanapp.cn/square) I deployed on Leancloud.
